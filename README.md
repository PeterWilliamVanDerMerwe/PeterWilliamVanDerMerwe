### Hey there, my name is Peter van der Merwe ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I am a gameplay programmer currently working at BizAr Reality where our amazing team creates mining training simulators.

âš¡ I am interested in making the best and most immersive gameplay for the player resulting in the most enjoyable experiences. 

ðŸŒ± I do majority of my work in Unity (C#) and some projects in Unreal Engine 5 (C++). I am passionate about what I do everyday and always look forward to new learning opportunities and most importantly making amazing games.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me at petervdm9@gmail.com.
